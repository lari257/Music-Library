# Music Library
This project implements a Music Library Management System in Java, providing functionalities to manage songs, podcasts, playlists, and user preferences. The system allows users to perform various operations, such as searching for songs, creating playlists, liking songs, and more.

In the second stage of the project, several new features have been introduced, building upon the solution for Stage 1. The key additions include the incorporation of artists and hostsâ€”privileged users with the ability to add and delete posts/items from their respective pages, such as merch, events, and announcements.

Processing Commands:

The processor iterates through a list of commands, updating timestamps and executing corresponding actions based on the command type. The commands are processed using a switch statement, where each case corresponds to a specific command, and the appropriate action is invoked through a CommandRunner class.

Usage
To use this command processor, create a list of CommandInput objects representing the commands you want to execute. The processor will iterate through each command, updating timestamps and performing the associated action.
